              Temujin, later Genghis Khan, was born around 1162 near the border
              between modern Mongolia and Siberia. Legend holds that he came
              into the world clutching a blood clot in his right hand. At that
              time, dozens of nomadic tribes on the central Asian steppe were
              constantly fighting and stealing from each other, and life for
              Temujin was violent and unpredictable. Before he turned 10, his
              father was poisoned to death by an enemy clan. Temujin’s own clan
              then deserted him, his mother and his six siblings. Then, Temujin
              killed his older half-brother and took over as head of the
              poverty-stricken household. In 1178 Temujin married Borte, with
              whom he would have four sons and an unknown number of daughters.
              He launched a daring rescue of Borte after she was kidnapped, and
              he soon began making alliances, building a reputation as a
              warrior, and attracting a growing number of followers.

              Genghis Khan established the largest contiguous land empire in
              human history, stretching from the Caspian Sea to China and over
              two continents. Often regarded as the greatest military commander
              of human history, Genghis Khan utilized archers on horseback,
              acute tactical adaptation, fear, and constant pressure to succeed
              in his many bloody conquests. After initial conquests, life in the
              Mongolian Empire was peaceful and tolerant, often regarded as the
              Pax Mongolica by historians. Kingdoms were allowed to retain their
              language, religion, and culture, and trade flourished along the
              Silk Road once more. Genghis Khan himself advocated for literacy
              and forbade infighting, theft, and the selling of women in the
              Mongol Empire.

                  The Mongols’ were the first modern army. Thoroughly
                  disciplined and highly mobile – infantry was unknown – it
                  could execute complex tactical manoeuvres in silence upon
                  orders from centralised command. Speed and efficiency in
                  conquest were their trademark, and the source of the fear they
                  struck in the enemy. Horse and bow where the Mongol warriors’
                  strength.

                  Warfare technology and logistics were other factors in the
                  Mongols’ superiority. The gunpowder formula was changed to
                  yield explosive force, rather than slow burn as in fire-lances
                  and rockets. Guns and cannon were developed. Specialised
                  troops of craftsmen were skilled in building complex siege
                  machines from local materials – obviating the need to move
                  them over long distances.

                  Without a production base on their own, the Mongols were
                  dependent on trade for their essentials and luxuries. They
                  secured the Silk Road, established free trade, and moved great
                  quantities of goods in either direction. It is along this
                  Mongol Silk Road that Marco Polo might have travelled to
                  Khubilai’s court. Eventually paper money was introduced from China.
